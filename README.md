Planning
----------
** Defining the Problem (Topic 1.1.1) **
This problem aims to help a business owner have a comprehensive system to keep track of the tasks that a car rental service would have to perform. This includes creating new cars within the system, logging trips, and keeping statistics of the mileage of various cars. This system hopes to be as easy to use as possible so the transition is quick and easy; the system will heavily minimize the amount of work that the car rental business has to do. Since the business owner is not especially familiar with computer programs, the solution will also attempt to be very easy to install and then easy to perform actions within the program.
