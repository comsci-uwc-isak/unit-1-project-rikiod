Reflection for Tuesday, September 24th
What did we do today: Today we practiced the planning for a few problems by listing the inputs, outputs, and steps. Later, we wrote about the significance of certain topics in the Mininal Car Rental problem that we were just assigned.
What I learned today: I learned more about the various topics we're going to study in this class. 
Questions: Does the car rental agency's data need to be actually stored on the computer? If so, how do you do that? We haven't really done anything like that so far although I suppose you could use a text file.
Homework: Write 100-150 words in the README about the importance of understanding the context for which a new system is planned.

Reflection for Wednesday, September 25th
Today we worked on a system disagram and installation script for the Minimal Car Rental problem. Both of these can now be found in the README of this repository. I was somewhat confused about the installation script and how to direct something towards a particular folder. The system diagram, however, made a lot of sense to me and was a great way to organize my thoughts for such a big project such as this. 

Reflection for Friday, September 27th 
We created a program which puts a message inside a box made of asteriks. It automatically adjusts for the length of the word and puts it inside the middle of the frame. 

Reflection for Monday, September 30th
We went over the Minimal Car Project inputs and outputs for creating trips and creating cars. Then, we were assigned another function to present at the next class.

Reflection for Wednesday, October 2nd
We all presented the various projects we had: these were either summarize, edit, delete, or backup. I presented backup and based off others' ideas, thought it would be good to put the backup inside of a folder explicitly called backup.
