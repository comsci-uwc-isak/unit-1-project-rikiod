Reflection for Tuesday, September 24th
What did we do today: Today we practiced the planning for a few problems by listing the inputs, outputs, and steps. Later, we wrote about the significance of certain topics in the Mininal Car Rental problem that we were just assigned.
What I learned today: I learned more about the various topics we're going to study in this class. 
Questions: Does the car rental agency's data need to be actually stored on the computer? If so, how do you do that? We haven't really done anything like that so far although I suppose you could use a text file.
Homework: Write 100-150 words in the README about the importance of understanding the context for which a new system is planned.
